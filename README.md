# IT Collect ITPfM Schema

This Repository hosts the API schema and other relevant documents related to the IT Collect ITPfM APIs. These APIs support federal agency users in managing and submitting their annual A-11 IT Spending data, which is then reported on the federal IT Dashboard (itdashboard.gov). There are three available services: 
- CPIC (Authenticated Federal Users Only)
- Statistics (Authenticated Federal Users Only)
- Public

To review the API schema, please visit our hosted schema docs, located at:

If you are a public user interested in leveraging our API, please register for a key by visiting:
