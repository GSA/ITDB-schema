# IT Collect-schema
The IT Dashboard team aims to build a modern API that acts as the center-piece of a modular IT data reporting ecosystem. This Github repository is supplied by GSA for the CPIC Community in support of this new modernized API, known as IT Collect. Here CPIC developers can find the latest OMB CPIC Guidance and the API Schema specs that show the direction of IT Collect data architecture. The repository’s aim is to provide real-time updates to the IT Collect API. It will serve as living documentation of the latest changes. This repository also contains information related to the IT Dashboard environment, which will remain active until the launch of IT Collect. 
 
 * Community members should be able to download the latest [BY 2023 A-11 Section 55](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/s55.pdf), and the [BY 2023 Submission Overview](https://itdashboard.gov/drupal/sites/itdb/files/BY_2023_IT_Collect_Submission%20_Overview.pdf).
 * Community members should be able to view the latest [IT Collect API Schema](https://gsa.github.io/ITDB-schema/).
 * As changes are made by IT Collect developers, the Open API spec will be automatically updated.
 * Members of this repository receive alerts when files are updated, assuming they subscribe to GitHub notifications.
 * A core team will monitor this repository for issues, questions and pull requests and will respond as issues and questions are raised and changes are proposed.

## IT Collect Documents
IT Collect How-To Guides and FAQ documents can be found in the [IT Collect Docs](https://github.com/GSA/ITDB-schema/tree/master/IT%20Collect%20Docs) folder in this repository. You can expect existing documents to be updated and new guides to be uploaded occasionally. We will communicate new document releases with the vendor community.
