# ITDB-schema
This repository is supplied by OMB for the CPIC Community. It's purpose is to act as a distrubution point of CPIC Guidance schema files and also to act as as collabrative forum for reviewing proposed schema changes. Here CPIC developers can find the latest OMB CPIC Guidance, XSD files, and their respective sample XML submission files, all of which will allow them to validate the structure of their own XML submission files. Our goals are as follow:
 
 * Community members should be able to download the latest CPIC Guidance, XSD and XML files.
 * As changes are made by OMB developers, the XSD and sample XML files will be automatically updated.
 * Members of this repository recieve alerts when files are updated, asssuming they subscribe to GitHub alerts.
 * Members of this repository may fork and create pull requests of this code base if they wish to suggest changes to the schema.
 * A core team will monitor this repository for issues, questions and pull requests and will respond as issues and questions are raised and changes are propsed.
