    "body": "When looking to make changes to the set of agency strategic objectives and performance goals (\"objectives\",) there continue to be issues in the logic checking the objectives list and also in comparing it to the metric objectives.  \r\n\r\nFor example, when adding to the list of investment objectives where existing objectives are already in place, errors are generated if, in the same file, metrics are being re-assigned to the new objectives.  This necessitates providing a second file with the metrics.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, in cases where the existing agency objective record is being changed from value 1 to value 2 and a new record is being created with value 1, an error is generated, apparently because the system adds the new record and determines there are now two records with value 1, before processing the update.  There is no simple workaround for this (particularly where metrics are using these values.)  We need to change the record IDs in our system to accomodate.\r\n\r\nAnother case that appears to have no workaround is where an investment has an objective with value 3 and a metric assigned to that objective.  The investment determines that it wants to change value 3 to value 4, both for the investment and the metric.  There appears to be no way to do this.  Instead, a new record needs to be added for the investment and the metric assigned to it.  Then, in a second file, the old record is deleted.\r\n\r\nThe general theme is that it appears that the logic for checking metrics could be improved.  In particular, I would expect the system to process all investment objective adds and updates before providing an error that there is a duplicate record.  Once that is complete, I would expect the system to process all metric adds and updates and determine if any metric objectives are invalid.\r\n\r\nI know that it was discussed last year and not changed due to time constraints, but an option that may again be worth considering is moving to a simple list for the agency objectives and goals, similar to the Paperwork Reduction Act control numbers list.  This would avoid the problem of managing record numbers, adds, and updates for a list that contains one element.  As the majority of the issues we encounter with changing goals and objectives occur during the annual submission window, we could manage to continue working around the existing issues without a fix if something like this was planned for the BY20 submission."

    "body": "As these are only warnings, this is not a critical issue for us during the current submission as we can ignore them.\r\n\r\nWhen submitting multiple ITS&C SIRs in a single XML file, incorrect warnings are generated.  It appear some are due to the validations comparing the data for each SIR to the totals from the IT Investment Portfolio Summary for the first SIR, rather than the current SIR.  As an example:\r\n```\r\ncheck Submission Successful for UII 009-000000001\r\ncheck Submission Successful for UII 009-000000002\r\ncostsAndCapabilitiesâ—¦warning The sum of all IT security compliance capabilities for PY ( 2.100000 ) should exactly match Total Security and Compliance Cost PY ( 1.100000 ) from the investment in the IT Portfolio.\r\nâ—¦warning The sum of all IT security compliance capabilities for CY ( 2.200000 ) should exactly match Total Security and Compliance Cost CY ( 1.200000 ) from the investment in the IT Portfolio.\r\nâ—¦warning The sum of all IT security compliance capabilities for BY ( 2.300000 ) should exactly match Total Security and Compliance Cost BY ( 1.300000 ) from the investment in the IT Portfolio.\r\nThe sum of capabilities for the PY ( 2.100000 ) should not be greater than the DME and O&M Agency PY Funding and Agency PY Contributions ( 1.100000 ) from the IT Portfolio.\r\nâ—¦warning The sum of capabilities for the CY ( 2.200000 ) should not be greater than the DME and O&M Agency CY Funding and Agency CY Contributions ( 1.200000 ) from the IT Portfolio.\r\nâ—¦warning The sum of capabilities for the BY ( 2.300000 ) should not be greater than the DME and O&M Agency BY Funding and Agency BY Contributions ( 1.300000 ) from the IT Portfolio.\r\n```\r\nIn the above, example, no warnings are received for 009-000000001 because the totals match.  However, 009-000000002 receives the above warnings even though $2.1m, $2.2m, and $2.3m are the correct numbers.  The amounts referenced in the warnings - $1.1m, $1.2m, and $1.3m - are the values for 009-000000001.  Note that if I also submit 009-000000003, warnings will continue to reference values from 009-000000001.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the calculations for the 10% warning on \"Other\" appear not to be reset to 0 for each SIR.  As an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncheck Submission Successful for UII 009-000000004\r\nâ—¦warning The amount of spending reported for Other Identify Capabilities (6) for PY ( 2.000000) for this investment should not exceed 10% of the total PY ( 2.000000) for all NIST Framework Category Identify for this investment\r\ncheck Submission Successful for UII 009-000000005\r\nâ—¦warning The amount of spending reported for Other Identify Capabilities (6) for PY ( 3.000000) for this investment should not exceed 10% of the total PY ( 1.000000) for all NIST Framework Category Identify for this investment\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, 009-000000004 has $2m in Other Identify, and it is correctly identified as having the entire $2m of Identify in \"Other\".  However, 009-000000005 is listed as having $3m in Other Identify, out of a total of $1m in Identify.  This does not make sense as \"Other\" cannot exceed 100%, and it appears that the issue is that the $3m comes from adding the totals for 009-000000004 and 009-000000005 rather than resetting them and showing $1m, the correct value in this case.  Note that 009-000000006 would continue to add, so if it had $0.5m in other, the warning would be based on $3.5m.\r\n"

This year some of those investments are no longer on the IT Portfolio so they can not be referenced in the Reduced/Eliminated Investments table.  I am trying to deactivate them but validation says that the UII does not exist in the IT Portfolio so I am getting a validation error.  \r\nWill send along a test file shortly. \r\nI also tried removing the 'deactivation' from the file but it still failed.  \r\n\r\nRecommendation: Do not validate the UII on a deactivation activity.  \r\n\r\nWill take a work around if one is available.
