suspicious activity we noticed in our server logs, in which a system was making requests for all of our data feeds every 10 minutes using a superuser API key.\r\r\r\rIt turned out that this was just an internal Data Warehouse script, so there was no problem, but it got us thinking that we should probably have some sort of monitoring in place to detect suspicious behavior in the form of API requests that use a superuser API key.\r\r\r\rI�۪m pretty sure the superuser API key is only needed for the Data Warehouse to pull data from the data feeds, and��it��is not needed��for any other purpose. If that is the case, the monitoring feature we implement should probably work like this:\r\r\r\rFor any API request using��an API key that belongs to a superuser (even an expired key or test key):\r\r # Allow access only if the IP address is that of the Data Warehouse and the requested URL is for a data feed download\r\r # Disallow access and trigger an alert email if any other IP address is detected\r\r # Disallow access and trigger an alert email if the request URL is for anything besides a data feed download","Environment":"","Watchers":"o003802","Log Work":"","Original Estimate":28800,"Remaining Estimate":0,"Time Spent":12600,"Work Ratio":"43%","� Original Estimate":28800,"� Remaining Estimate":0,"� Time Spent":12600,"Security Level":"","Outward issue link (Cloners)":"","Attachment":"","Custom field (2nd Tier Release Contact)":"","Custom field (3rd Party Support Notes)":"","Custom field (AC Peer Review?)":"","Custom field (AC Peer Reviewer)":"","Custom field (Acceptance Criteria)":"See Dave's comment for test setup.\r\r1.

This can lead to major errors. We need to get under the hood and look.\r\r\r\r*RECOMMENDATION:*\r\r Do eight hours of investigation to find LOE of greater task.\r\r\r\r*ESTIMATE:*\r\r 2 Story Points\r\r{panel}\r\r{panel:title=Developer Background}\r\rThere are many instances in the code where we make assumptions about getting expected data, like so...\r\r{code:java}\r\r$tp1 = getTimePeriodFromITPortfolio(); // expected to be an integer\r\r$tp2 = getTimePeriodFromInvestmentEvent(); // expected to be an integer\r\rif ($tp1 == $tp2) {\r\r    doThis();\r\r} else {\r\r    doThat();\r\r}\r\r{code}\r\rIn this case, we expect $tp1 and $tp2 to be integers, but what if getTimePeriodFromInvestmentEvent() returns null for some reason? Assuming getTimePeriodFromITPortfolio() returns an integer as expected, we will doThat() because $tp1 and $tp2 are not equal, but is that really what we want to do in this case? Probably not, and what we really should do is throw an exception (trigger an error that terminates the script) because we have encountered bad data, and it would be risky to continue along with logic that might be faulty due to that bad data.\r\r\r\rWe implemented a new ApiExceptionDebug class for -IEEUIT-3317- QA issue #1 that can be used to trigger exceptions in a way that shows a friendly error message to the user while writing debug info to the error log for developers. Using that class, the above code might be rewritten like so:\r\r{code:java}\r\r$tp1 = getTimePeriodFromITPortfolio(); // expected to be an integer\r\rif (!$tp1) {\r\r    throw new APIExceptionDebug(\"An error has occurred\", \" getTimePeriodFromITPortfolio() returned empty or null\");\r\r}\r\r$tp2 = getTimePeriodFromInvestmentEvent(); // expected to be an integer\r\rif (!$tp2) {\r\r    throw new APIExceptionDebug(\"An error has occurred\", \" getTimePeriodFromInvestmentEvent() returned empty or null\");\r\r}\r\rif ($tp1 == $tp2) {\r\r    doThis();\r\r} else {\r\r    doThat();\r\r}\r\r{code}\r\rSo the task for this ticket is to conduct a review of the code, looking for these sorts of \"soft\" spots, and refactor the code to harden things up. Note that there are undoubtedly hundreds or even thousands of soft spots like these, occurring in all areas of the system, so this will be a huge task that also requires a lot of regression testing. It is probably best done piecemeal as an ongoing task that we squeeze in whenever possible, working on one class or set of classes at a time, then testing and verifying that work before moving on to the next.\r\r{panel}\r\r\r\rFY19
