This is the identifier depicting agency code and unique Investment number used to report the Investment in the previous FY 2018 Agency IT Portfolio Summary submission to OMB.

The Current UII includes an agency code and a nine-digit unique identifier. Variable information formerly included in the UII of previous years is not part of the UII primary key.
XXX- xxxxxxxxx: The first three digits represent your agency code (see  Appendix C of OMB Circular No. A-11).
xxx- XXXXXXXXX: The last nine digits serve as the Investment’s unique identifier. This identifier should be system-generated and applied at the agency level. It will allow Agencies up to one billion unique identifiers to associate with IT Investments. Once used, the unique identifier must be retired from use for any future new Investment and should remain unchanged for any continuing Investment that is not split, consolidated, reorganized. If an IT Investment is retired, discontinued, or merged with another IT Investment, the UII persists with that IT Investment.",,6.

Agencies must continue to report the two standard Investments introduced last year; IT Security programs should be reflected within an Investment called IT Security and Compliance and use Category 02, and all CIO Function Investments should be reflected within an Investment called IT Management and use Category 03. Three additional standard Investments are being introduced: Network, Data Center and Cloud, and End User. Reporting these three new standard Investments is optional in FY 2019 and will be required in FY 2020. Agencies are encouraged to begin re-aligning Part 3 costs based upon these standard Investments.

Because Agencies are transitioning to this TBM-based model, but the full model will not be available it is critical that Agencies leverage the structure for elements in infrastructure Investments that don’t fit into the previous sections. In all instances for these Investments Agencies may downgrade a “Major” Part 3 Investment to “06: Non-Standard Infrastructure Investment” provided that they have disaggregated to the greatest extent practical through the use of the other “Standard Investments”. Additionally, agencies may not have the capacity or the maturity to deliver all of the available Standard Investment reporting identified in the prior sections of this guidance.
